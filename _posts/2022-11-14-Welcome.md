title: About Me
---

Welcome to my webpage. I'm a Nuclear Packaging Design Analyst at [Holtec International](https://holtecinternational.com/), a Delaware Corporation, which is considered the leader of innovation in the civil nuclear packaging industry. Holtec is a challenging work place and my experience here has been very much rewarding and enriching. My team designs and analyzes Structures, Systems and Components in Nuclear Facilities for structural integrity in their intended functionality across the globe.

I hold a Masters degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu/). I completed my undergraduate degree (also in mechanical engineering) from [Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology, Bhopal](http://www.manit.ac.in/). Prior joining Purdue University, I worked for a leading oil and petroleum sector consultancy firm in India where I did system engineering and configuration design (detailed engineering) of various petroleum facilities across India. If you are driving a car in India, it is highly probable that you are running on fuel refined in one of the units, I was involved in designing.

I like numbers & logic and hence I am very interested in computational engineering. I also find the physics of dynamics and vibrations very appealing. Stop back frequently as I intend to make several enhancements to the website in the near future.

Thanks for reading!
